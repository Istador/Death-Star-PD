        They come in bulk and seek destruction, but they made one mistake: challenging you.
        The Imperial Military needs you in its campaign against the disreputable rebels that aim to destroy <span class="b">your</span> deathstar.
        Will you join the fight?
        </p>
        <p>
        Deathstar&nbsp;PD allows you to build and upgrade towers that will attack enemies that come in range.
        Limited credits and cookies (also known as energy) - the main ressources in the game - forces you to make meaningful decissions and plan ahead where and what to construct.
        17 waves of enemies, that are constantly getting stronger and more numerous, are awaiting you.
